    Changed equip.c to implement wear() and wield() in a more
    felxible way and with more generality. Meanwhile, method
    of implementing two-handed weapon and secondhand weapon
    also changed that it requires another skill for such case
    now. (i.e. using a dagger as main weapon and as secondary
    weapon now requires different skill)

    Fixed a logical error in checking eq wear_as and wield_as
    procedure. (a really silly one)

    inflict_damage() in equip.c was not counting the damage
    apply from query_temp("apply/damage"). Now fixed.

    Added a HP (hit points) statistic implementation in
    statistic.c

    Changed statistic health_regenerator to NOT regenerate in
    combat. Because the unlimited advancing system, some player
    may got too high statistics that can fight lower level npc
    even in sleep! Add this to make them risk exhausting.
