    Changed killer structure in attack.c to mapping. That is,
    number of enemies of certain id we are killing is also
    kept for killing state check. This is to fix the bug about
    killing state canceled when killing enemies of same id in
    the same room.

    Added abandon_skill() to let player stop learning specific
    skill. (This is implemented by setting an abandon flag on
    skill_flag, original skill level is still kept)
