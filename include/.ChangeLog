    Added SAVE_USER option in login.h. Undefing it prevents
    user from saving data (connection object and body object).

    Fixed the way dbase_security.h checks for euid. Now only
    checks calls from call_other for euid of previous_object().
    This will allow all local functions to use set() without
    security check and make better performance.
