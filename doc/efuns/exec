          This efunction allows the interactive link to a given object
          to be migrated to another object.  That is, after a
          successful exec(to, from) call, interactive(to) will return
          1 and interactive(from) will return 0.  The player that was
          controlling 'from' will begin controlling 'to' following the
          exec() call.  Note that this is a powerful function and its
          use must be restricted if you wish to attempt to have a
          secure mud.  The proper way to restrict the use of exec() is
          to make a simul_efun of the same name and then use
          valid_override(4) to restrict the use of a simul_efun
          override (i.e. efun::exec()).  The exec() function returns 1
          if the switch is successful (and 0 otherwise).
