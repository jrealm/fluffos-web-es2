          Both domain_stats() and author_stats() return information
          stored in a mapping.  If no argument is specified, then
          information is returned on all domains (or on all authors)
          with one map entry per domain or author.  If an argument is
          specified, then a map is returned that corresponds to that
          domain or author with keys: moves, cost, errors,
          heart_beats, worth, array_size, and objects.  Each of these
          map to integer values.  Moves is the number of objects that
          have moved into objects in the given domain.  Cost is the
          number of evaluations (eval_cost) accumulated by objects
          with the given domain (or author).  Errors is the number of
          errors incurred by objects with the given domain.
          Heart_beats is the number of heartbeat calls made on objects
          having the given domain.  Worth is the value maintained by
          the add_worth(3) efunction (this is usually used to keep
          track of how much money a given wizard has given out vs.
          taken in).  Array_size is the size (in bytes) of the arrays
          allocated by the domain.  Objects is the number of objects
          created by the given domain.  When called with no arguments,
          the returned mapping has a form like this:

               ([ domain0 : info0, domain1 : info1, ... ])

          while info0 has the form:

               ([ "moves" : moves, "cost" : cost, "errors" : errors,
                  "heart_beats" : heart_beats, "worth" : worth,
                  "array_size" : array_size, "objects" : objects ])

          When called with an argument, the returned mapping will have
          the form of info0.
