          dump_socket_status() is a diagnostic facility which displays
          the current status of all LPC sockets configured into the
          MudOS driver.  It is useful for debugging LPC sockets
          applications.  Each row in the output corresponds to a
          single LPC socket.  The first row corresponds to LPC socket
          descriptor 0, the second row, 1, etc.  The total number of
          sockets is configured when the driver is built.

          The first column "Fd" is the operating system file
          descriptor associated with the LPC socket.  "State" is the
          current operational state of the LPC socket.  "Mode" is the
          socket mode, which is passed as an argument to
          socket_create().  The local and remote addresses are the
          Internet address and port numbers in Internet dot notations.
          '*' indicates an address or which is 0.  N.B. LPC sockets
          that are in the CLOSED state are not currently in use;
          therefore the data displayed for that socket may be
          idiosyncratic.

          The following output was generated on Portals, where the
          only socket application running at the time was MWHOD.  It
          indicates that two sockets are current in use, one is
          listening for connection requests on a STREAM mode socket.
          The other is waiting for incoming data on a DATAGRAM mode
          socket.
