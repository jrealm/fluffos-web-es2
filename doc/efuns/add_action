          Set up a local function <fun> to be called when user input
          matches the command <cmd>. Functions called by a player
          command will get the arguments as a string. It must then
          return 0 if it was the wrong command, otherwise 1.

          If the second argument is an array, then all the commands in
          the array will call the second function.  It is possible to
          find out which command called the function with
          query_verb().

          If it was the wrong command, the parser will continue
          searching for another command, until one returns true or
          give error message to player.

          Usually add_action() is called only from an init() routine.
          The object that defines commands must be present to the
          player, either being the player, being carried by the
          player, being the room around the player, or being an object
          in the same room as the player.

          If argument <flag> is 1, then only the leading characters of
          the command has to match the verb <cmd> and the entire verb
          is returned by query_verb().  If argument <flag> is 2, then
          again, only the leading characters must match, but
          query_verb() will only return the characters following
          <cmd>.
