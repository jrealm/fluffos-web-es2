          Return the object representing the player that caused the
          calling function to be called.  Note that this_player() may
          return a different value than this_object() even when called
          from within a player object.  If this_player is called as
          this_player(1) then the returned value will be the
          interactive that caused the calling function to be called.
          this_player(1) may return a different value than
          this_player() in certain cases (such as when command() is
          used by an admin to force a player to perform some command).
