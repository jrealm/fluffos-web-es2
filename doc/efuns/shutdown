          This function shuts down the driver in a controlled fashion
          (as opposed to how a crash would shut it down).  The 'how'
          argument specifes what integer value that driver should pass
          to exit().  The convention is to pass 'how' as -1 when the
          script that restarts the driver should die as well.  Thus a
          reboot command would use shutdown() while a halt command
          would use shutdown(-1).  The script must explicitly check
          the return value to see if it is -1 if you wish to use this
          convention.  Obviously, shutdown() is a sensitive function
          and should be secured.  As with exec(), the way to make it
          secure is to add a simul_efun of the same name which does
          the appropriate security checks.  Be sure to set
          valid_override(4) up (in master.c) to protect against
          efun::shutdown().
