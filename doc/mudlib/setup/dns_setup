¡¼ Setting up Intermud
 
Service: channels, who, finger, mudlist
 
ES2 mudlib release default has DNS disabled, you can load it for the
first time by sending message through any of the intermud channel or by
loading dns_master.c located in /adm/daemons/network, if you want the
mud to load dns_master everytime the mud restarts, uncomment the line
that loads dns_master in /adm/etc/preload.
 
Before you connect yourself to the Intermud, please make sure everything
is setup correctly, if for some reason they are not setup right, your mud
will confuse other muds on the network and cause a lot of problems.
 
For ES2 mudlib, the relating files are /adm/daemons/network/*,
/include/net/* and mudlib.h, among them, the most important one is
mudlib.h, and you can ignore the rest, for now, unless your intermud
doesn't work and your mudlib.h ios setup correctly. (See Debug section)
 
defines in mudlib.h:
MUDLIB_NAME -- Name of the mudlib this mud is using. Unless you've
               changed at least 50% of the mudlib codes, it is better
               to ask for permission before you change this item.
MUDLIB_VERSION_NUMBER -- Version for the mudlib you were using, you can
               change this to reflect the status of your mudlib.
INTERMUD_MUD_NAME -- The name that will appear on the mudlist, please
               note, not everyone on the intermud can read/interpret big5
               characters, so don't use it.
 
Intermud channels:
gwiz - general wiz channel - This is the general channel for wiz on the
               intermud, all the muds will receive messages sending from
               this channel, so please don't use any big5 code.
twiz - taiwan wiz channel  - a wiz only channal for all the connecting muds
               belong to the 140.* domains.
es - general player channel for eastern stories series mudlib - this is the
               channel for players to communicate with each other across
               the mud that runs eastern stories mudlibs. (any version)
 
Intermud intro:
 
Protocol (I2)
(unfinished...)
 
Debug:
files: /log/dns_warning, /log/dns_fake, /include/net/config.h,
/include/net/services.h
 
If your intermud doesn't work, and you are *sure* mudlib.h is set up
correctly, type mudlist and see if you are getting any mudlist at all,
normally you should be getting 6x - 8x muds within 5 minutes of loading
dns_master. If this is not the case, check /include/net/config.h and make
sure that at least one of the muds listed in MUDLIST_DNS, MUDLIST_BAK or
LISTNODES is up, if not, try to find a mud that you know is up for sure
and set the addresses accordingly. Update dns_master when you are done.
 
If this still doesn't work, check /log/dns_warning to see if there's any
"fail to open socket" message, if so, then perhaps the default DNS port
is used by some other process and can not be opened by dns_master, default
DNS port is set to mud port +4 for ES2 mudlib, and can be changed in
/include/net/services.h
