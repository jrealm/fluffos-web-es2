    NAME
        relay_channel -- interface for channel message
 
    SYNOPSIS
        void relay_channel(object ob, string msg);
 
    DESCRIPTION
        relay_channel, if present in the object, will be called whenever
	a message is sent to the channel that this object is registered
	with. The entire channel message and the object who says it will
	be passed as the parameters. 
        
	In order for a non-player control object to receive channel 
	message, the object has to call register_relay_channel and pass 
	the name of the desired channel as an argument.
	
	This is used as an interface for NPC to handle any interaction 
	triggered by the said channel messages.
