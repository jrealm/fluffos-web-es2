          The clean_up() function is called by the driver on a regular
          basis in all objects that have been inactive for the time
          specified for clean_up() in the runtime configuration file.
          One flag is passed to the function, specifying whether or
          not the object has been inheritted by anything.  If
          clean_up() returns 0, clean_up() will never be called again
          on that object.  If it returns 1, it will be called again
          when the object remains inactive for the specified
          clean_up() delay.

          One thing that might be commonly done by an object in this
          function is destructing itself to conserve memory.
