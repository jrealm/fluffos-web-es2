          Every object should have a create function defined within
          it.  Within that function, all initial object initialization
          should be done.  create() is called on *all* objects.
          *NOTE* - This behavior is different than the stock 3.1.2
          LPmud driver.  In 3.1.2, if an object is created first by
          being inherited, then create() wasn't called on it.  In
          MudOS, this behavior has changed so that it is *always*
          called when an object is created.  As a result, you may see
          some odd behavior if you have a create in a parent object
          that does a write, you will see two writes, as if create()
          had been called twice on the same object.  In reality,
          create *is* being called twice, but on two *different*
          objects: the parent, and the child that is calling
          parent::create() manually.
