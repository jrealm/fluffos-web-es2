          After every reset interval (whose exact length is determined
          on a mud by mud basis, but averages around every 2 hours),
          reset() is called in every object that currently exists.  If
          LAZY_RESETS is defined in options.h in the driver, reset()
          will only be called in objects when they are touched (near
          players), so unused objects will not be loaded from the swap
          file to reset.  The reset() call is usually used to check if
          any treasures and/or monsters in the room have been removed
          so they can be replaced.
