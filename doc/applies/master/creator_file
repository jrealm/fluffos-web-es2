          The creator_file() function is called in the master object
          each time a new object is created.  The `filename' of the
          object is passed as the sole parameter, and the string that
          creator_file() returns is set as the new object's uid.  If
          the AUTO_SETEUID option is enabled at compile-time of the
          driver, it is also set as the new object's euid.

          One exception: if the AUTO_TRUST_BACKBONE option is enabled
          at compile-time of the driver, and creator_file() returns
          the backbone uid (as specified by get_bb_uid() in the master
          object), the object is given the uid and euid of the object
          that loaded it.
