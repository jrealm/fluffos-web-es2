          The driver calls epilog() in master after the master object
          has been loaded.  Mudlibs typically use epilog to initialize
          data structures in master (such as security tables etc).
          epilog() should returns an array of filenames which
          correspond to objects that the mudlib wants to have
          preloaded; that is, loaded before the first player logs in.
          For each filename returned in the array, the driver will
          called preload(filename) in master.

          The variable 'load_empty' is non-zero if the -e option was
          specified when starting up the driver.  It can be used as a
          signal to the mudlib to not load castles, etc.
