          The driver calls crash() in master in the event that the
          driver crashes (segmentation fault, bus error, etc).  This
          function offers a way to shutdown the mudlib (safe players
          and other important data) before the driver crashes.  It
          also lets you log various useful information such as what
          signal crashed the driver, what object was active, who the
          current player was etc.
