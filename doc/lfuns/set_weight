       set_weight()  sets/changes  the  net weight of an item and
       keeps track of the actual weight of  its  container.  Note

       weight of its inventory. Changing the weight  of  an  item
       when  the  item  is  contained  by  another item will also
       updates the actual weight of its container(s).
