       start_busy()  - set the character into busy state by wait-
       ing or calling specific function in its heart_bear, ignor-
       ing original tasks done by heart_beat (combat...etc.).

       busy_func, int min_count | function intr_func );

       If the first argument is an integer, the character will be
       busy  for hb_count heart beats. If the first argument is a
       function, the function is called every heart beat until it
       returns  zero.  Some  commands  and/or actions check for a
       characrter's busy state before they take  further  process
       of  command, and prevent players from doing something when
       busy. For the busy-state system  to  work  correctly,  any
       actions  yielding  a  busy state must check for busy state
       before they set player into busy state.

       The second argument is optional, which specifies the mini-
       mum  heart beats before the busy state can be interrupted.
       If it is an integer,  interrupt  will  be  accepted  after
       min_count'th  heart  beats  of this busy. If it is a func-
       tion, interrupt will be accepted only if the evaluation of
       intr_func returns non-zero.

       Note  that some interrupt are non-ignorable: all interrupt
       reasons started with '*' are always accepted.
