ES2 New Wiz Document English draft (Tue  08-08-95)
 
1. Responsibility
 
-What is a wizard?
A wizard is a programmer, a creator, who creates areas for the mud. In LPmud,
anything can be done, therefore the position of being a wizard is a
privileged job and also a job with responsibilties.
Being a wizard means you can kill a player instantly, created a deadly
monster that walks around the realms, or make a world that everyone enjoys
living in. Anything you can think of, you can do it within the mud.
 
-The hierarchy of wizhood and who they are/what do they do:
admin       : the person in charge of the whole mud, and the person who
              is making all the major decisions on the mud. All the words
              from an admin is final. In short, admin is the law.
arch        : admin's assistance, usually someone who is familiar
              with the system in general and handles most of the QC
              requests. this is also the person to ask if you have
              system related questions.
wizard      : the major force in creating new areas. observe the wizard
              rules and behaves.
apprentice  : wizard in training. at this stage, you will want to get
              yourself familiar with the mud as a whole and the rules of
              wizards. You need to know that you are no longer a player,
              but someone in control on the creation of the world. Get
              to know all the responsibilities of being a wizard and adjust
              your attitude.
 
-Philosophy:
Being a wizard is like holding an endless power source, anything can be
done and think before you start doing anything. Also be prepared to
face the consequence that you or your codes created and be responsible.
When you are doing something, always keep in mind that your action will
effect the whole mud (or game system) no matter how insignificant it is.
 
Respect those who are in higher ranks and remember, if you can be promoted,
so can you be demoted.
 
2. QC
 
-Why QC?
Before an area is opened to the players, or being "explored" by players,
the area must be checked by either an admin or the arch wizard of the mud
to ensure the consisitency of the areas within the mud and also to make
sure all the codes will be working properly. Please noted, under no
circumsance an un-check object can be accessed or touched by players unless
you have the permission from the admins. Testing directly on players is not
recommanded and the permission will not be given out without a very good
reason. Usually your area will need a lot of modifications before it can be
opened, this is to ensure that your area will fit into the game and won't
create problems to the players or to the entire game system. Also, balance
will be a major consideration as well.
 
-New Areas
Before you start a project on writing new areas, it is recommanded that you
first check with your arch wizard or mud admin to make sure that the
planned area will fit into the theme of the mud. It is better to do so
early on the stage then to re-write the entire area after you are done with
it.
 
-Preparation:
To submit a QC request for your area, first make sure that ALL your rooms
and exits will work properly and all the functions within will work as well.
During the process of QC, you should make yourself available most of the
time in case something comes up and need to be asked or corrected right
away.
 
-Maintenance:
Your job is not done after your area is opened to the players, maintenance
of the is as important as is to code the area. The system is changing from
time to time and so will your area requires to be changed. Pay close
attention to the system related announcement and make changes to your area
accordingly. If you are going to have major changes, please go through the
QC process again.
