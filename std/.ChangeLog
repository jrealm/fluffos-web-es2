    Added signature support to bboard.c, it will append the
    string this_player()->link()->query("signature") to the
    text to be posted. Later I'll add a regular way to set 
    this string.

    Added MUCH better check on wandering NPCs created by room
    objects. Now rooms with wandering NPCs in other room won't
    clean up as long as these NPCs keep wandering. If the room
    is force destructed, these wandering NPCs are also force
    destructed as well with proper message. (Currently this 
    could only happen when some wiz dest or update a room
    manually.)

    Added busy state checking in move() of char.c to prevent
    moving with add_action's to avoid busy penalty.
